1. With React and the Github API, display the list of public repositories of the 7geese organization, ordered by fork count desc.
2. For each item show: repo name, fork number, language and created date.
3. Format the repository title to have hyphens replaced by spaces, and each word capitalized except: "as", "on"
Example: "this-is-a-test-on-javascript" becomes "This Is A Test on Javascript".
4. Add the ability to search for repos by name.
5. Put your solution in a zip file and email it back to us!
