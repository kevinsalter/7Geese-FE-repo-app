The scaffolding for this was created with `create-react-app`

`yarn install`
    Installs dependencies.

`yarn start`
  Starts the development server.

`yarn run build`
  Bundles the app into static files for production.

`yarn test`
  Starts the test runner.

`yarn run eject`
  Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
  and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!
